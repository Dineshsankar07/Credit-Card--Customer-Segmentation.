# Credit-Card--Customer-Segmentation.
 The goal of this project is to leverage ML model to segment customers for launching a specific targeted Ad-campaign. To make it successful, we have to segment them in at-least 3 distinct groups known as "marketing segmentation". It will help to maximize the marketing campaign conversion rate. 
 Approach:
• Exploratory Data Analysis, Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using 
elbow method.
• k-means to perform customer segmentation.
• Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
